Call for Papers

First International Symposium on Big Data Computing (BDC 2014) 
December 8-11, 2014, London, UK
http://www.cloudbus.org/bdc2014 

In conjunction with:
7th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2014)

Introduction
===============================================================================
Rapid advances in digital sensors, networks, storage, and computation along 
with their availability at low cost is leading to the creation of huge 
collections of data -- dubbed as Big Data. This data has the potential for 
enabling new insights that can change the way business, science, and 
governments deliver services to their consumers and can impact society as a 
whole. This has led to the emergence of the Big Data Computing paradigm 
focusing on sensing, collection, storage, management and analysis of data from 
variety of sources to enable new value and insights. 

To realize the full potential of Big Data Computing, we need to address 
several challenges and develop suitable conceptual and technological solutions 
for dealing them. These include life-cycle management of data, large-scale 
storage, flexible processing infrastructure, data modelling, scalable machine 
learning and data analysis algorithms, techniques for sampling and making 
trade-off between data processing time and accuracy, and dealing with privacy 
and ethical issues involved in data sensing, storage, processing, and actions.

The International Symposium on Big Data Computing (BDC) 2014 -- held 
in conjunction with 7th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud 
Computing (UCC 2014), December 8-11, 2014, London, UK, aims at bringing 
together international researchers, developers, policy makers, and users and 
to provide an international forum to present leading research activities, 
technical solutions, and results on a broad range of topics related to Big 
Data Computing paradigms, platforms and their applications. The conference 
features keynotes, technical presentations, posters, workshops, tutorials, as 
well as competitions featuring live demonstrations.

PAPER SUBMISSION
===============================================================================
Authors are invited to submit papers electronically. Submitted manuscripts 
should be structured as technical papers and may not exceed 10 letter size 
(8.5 x 11) pages including figures, tables and references using the CPS format 
for conference proceedings (print area of 6-1/2 inches (16.51 cm) wide by 8-7/8 
inches (22.51 cm) high, two-column format with columns 3-1/16 inches (7.85 cm) 
wide with a 3/8 inch (0.81 cm) space between them, single-spaced 10-point Times 
fully justified text). Submissions not conforming to these guidelines may be 
returned without review. Authors should submit the manuscript in PDF format and 
make sure that the file will print on a printer that uses letter size (8.5 x 11) 
paper. The official language of the meeting is English. All manuscripts will be 
reviewed and will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, 
significance, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the 
conference attendees. Papers conforming to the above guidelines can be 
submitted through the BDC 2014 paper submission system 
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bdc2014).

Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not 
currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not 
following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further action 
may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the heads 
of the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference. Submissions 
received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately 
structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact the conference PC 
Chair for more information.
